## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start the server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/our-services

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=30d

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Frontend Configuration

Make sure your frontend has the correct API URL in the environment:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

## Authentication System

### Login Flow
1. User provides mobile number and password
2. Backend validates credentials and returns JWT token
3. Frontend stores token for authenticated requests

### Forgot Password Flow
1. User provides mobile number
2. Backend generates temporary password (8 characters)
3. Temporary password is returned in response
4. User logs in with temporary password
5. User changes password after successful login

### Security Features
- No signup functionality (users must be pre-created)
- Mobile number-based authentication
- Temporary password generation for password recovery
- JWT token-based session management
- Password hashing with bcrypt

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Service Management**
- Full CRUD operations for services
- Category and subcategory support
- Image management
- Pricing with currency support
- Availability and time slot management
- Rating and review integration
- Provider-specific service management

### 2. **Booking System**
- Create bookings with time slot validation
- Booking status management (pending, confirmed, in-progress, completed, cancelled)
- Address tracking for service delivery
- Provider and customer booking views
- Daily booking limits and free transaction tracking

### 3. **Review System**
- Add reviews with ratings (1-5 stars)
- Automatic calculation of service average ratings
- Review management (update, delete)
- Service-specific review aggregation

### 4. **User Management**
- JWT-based authentication with mobile number
- Profile management with address and currency
- Password change functionality

4. **Service Discovery**: Users can browse, search, and filter services
5. **Booking Process**: Users book services with time slot validation
6. **Service Delivery**: Providers manage bookings and update status
7. **Review System**: Users can review completed services
8. **Notifications**: Real-time updates for all activities

## Security Features

- JWT token authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- CORS configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control
- Rate limiting ready (can be added)
- No signup functionality (controlled user creation)

## Testing

The backend is ready for testing with tools like:
- Postman
- Insomnia
- curl
- Thunder Client (VS Code extension)

## Deployment Ready

The backend is production-ready with:
- Environment-based configuration
- Error handling and logging
- Database connection management
- Security best practices
- Comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Start the backend server** on port 5000
2. **Configure your frontend** to use the new API endpoints
3. **Test all functionality** to ensure everything works
4. **Deploy to production** when ready

## Support

The backend is fully documented with:
- Comprehensive README.md
- API endpoint documentation
- Data model specifications
- Error handling guidelines

All frontend functionality should now work seamlessly with the backend. The API is designed to be scalable and maintainable for future enhancements.
